      `Kris was very engaged and active throughout the 12-week cohort. 
      She asked great questions and wanted to know as much as possible about a given technology. 
      Kris always followed the instructions & guidance provided by her instructional team precisely and promptly. 
      She demonstrated the ability to learn and absorb the curriculum well-above that of a typical student. 
      Kris got along extremely well with her fellow classmates, was always willing to help others, 
      and demonstrated leadership by organizing study sessions, etc. 
      As Kristina's former Software Engineering Lead Instructor I can wholeheartedly recommend her for a role as a junior full-stack developer!`

      `Kris was very immersed during her time in the General Assembly Software Engineer Immersive Cohort. 
      Kris demonstrated excellent technical understanding of the material and even organized study sessions daily during after hours to help out fellow students. Kris always applied herself beyond what was expected and was always researching additional ways to add improved experiences in her projects. As Kris's former Instructional Associate I can attest that she would be an amazing addition to any team.`
